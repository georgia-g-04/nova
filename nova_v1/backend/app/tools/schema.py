"""
Defines the standard format for describing a Function tool.

Every Function tool in Nova has a ToolSchema which tells the registry:
    - what the tool is called
    - what it does
    - what inputs it needs
    - how proactive vs reactive it is (gain)


Example use:

ToolSchema(
    name="query_memory",
    description="Search stored user memories and past events.",
    input_schema={...},
    gain=0.5,
)
